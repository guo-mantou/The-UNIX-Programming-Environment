# 3-14

**Exercise 3-14**. Compare the here-document version of 411 with the original. Which is 
easier to maintain? Which is a better basis for a general service?

**Answer**:

Original version of 411:
```
    grep $* /usr/you/lib/phone-book
```

Here-document version of 411:
```
    grep "$*" <<End
    dial-a-joke  212-976-3838
    dial-a-prayer  212-246-4200
    dia santa  212-976-3636
    dow jones report  212-976-4141
    End
```

In my opinion, the original version is easier to maintain, because it's leaner than the other. 
Whenever something changes, for instance, the directory of your phone-book is changed to `/home/gsj/phone-book`, the only thing you should do is just update its search path.

Instead I think the here-document version is a better basis for a general service, for that it is independent of run-time environment.
