# 3-16

**Exercise 3-16**. What happens if the last line of the line of the loop above is 
```
        > done | pr | lpr &
```
that is, ends with an ampersand? See if you can figure it out, then try it.

**Answer**:

If the last line ends with an ampersand, this loop will run background.

In my environment, no printer is available, which means the part `| lpr` will report
 an error `lpr: Error - No default destination.`. 

 If you drop that part, the last line will be `> done | pr &`, shell show the pids of
 both processes and output almost immediately after executing it, like:
 ```
 [1] 15898 15899

 ... ...
 output contents
 ... ...

 [1]  + 15898 done       for i in 3-*.md; do; echo $i; done |
        15899 done       pr

 ```

Note: `pick` in Linux is different with counterpart in UNIX, so I have no idea with
 the original loop program. The answer above is concluded by executing:
 ```
    for i in 3-*.md
    do
        echo $i:
    done | pr &
 ```
which is just a poor facsimile.

That's all.
