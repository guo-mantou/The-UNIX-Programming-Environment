# 3-13

**Exercise 3-13**. Why do we always include the current directory in *PATH*? Where
should it be placed?

**Answer**:

> Why do we always include the current directory in *PATH*?

Maybe for convenience reason?? 

In fact, in Linux, `.` is excluded in `PATH` for security reasons. Think about 
an extreme example,  which an ordinary user created a shell script such 
as `rm -r /`, which would delete all files and directories in the system, and 
named this script `ls`. Were the system administrator to navigate to the directory 
in which this script resides, and attempt to run the standard `ls` command in 
order to view the contents of that directory, the shell would instead run the 
script with the same name and thereby remove the contents of all currently 
mounted partitions on the computer!

Therefore, `.` should never be placed in `PATH`!
