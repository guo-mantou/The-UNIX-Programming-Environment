# 3-9

Exercise 3-9. Look in */bin* and */usr/bin* to see how many commands are actually 
shell files. Can you do it with one command? Hint: *file(1)*. How accurate are 
guesses based on file length?

Answer:

To do this, just type these two commands:
```
    $ cd /bin; file * | grep shell | wc -l
```
and
```
    $ cd /usr/bin; file * | grep shell | wc -l
```

Actually, because */bin* is a link to */usr/bin* in Ubuntu 20.04, both commands result same output.
