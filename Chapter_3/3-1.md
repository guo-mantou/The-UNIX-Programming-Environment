# 3-1

Exercise 3-1. What are the differences among the following three commands?
```sh
$ cat file | pr
$ pr <file
$ pr file
```
(Over the years the redirection operator *<* has lost some ground to pipes; people seem to 
find *"cat file |"* more natural than *"<file"*.)


Answer:

> $ cat file | pr

`cat` command output the contents of file to stdout then `pr` reads it by pipe and does not know 
where the contents come from.

> $ pr \<file

`pr` reads file's contents by redirection and it does not know where the contents come from.

> $ pr file

`pr` process file by argument so it knows where the contents come from.
