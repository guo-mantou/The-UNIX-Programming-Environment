# 3-10

Exercise 3-10. If the backslashes are omitted in 
```
    $ echo `echo \`date\``
```
what happens?

Answer:

If we omit the backslashes, the statement will be 
```
    $ echo `echo `date``
```
The **\`echo\`** results nothing, **date** becomes literal, **\`\`** results nothing.
So the output will be:
```
    date
```
Done!
