# 3-11

**Exercise 3-11**. Try
```
    $ `date`
```
and explain the result.

**Answer**:

The result will be something like:
```
  zsh:1: command not found: Fri  
```
It is easy to explain why by using knowledge we've learnt.
That is the shell (here's **zsh**) tried to execute the output produced 
by command `date`.

Normally, when we execute `date` and we will get time like below:
```
    $ date
    Fri 08 Oct 2021 10:01:40 PM CST
```

And when we do 
```
    $ `date`
```
the shell will take the first word of output of `date` (here's **Fri**) as
a command and the left content as arguments of the command. So when shell 
cannot find **Fri** in your environment variable `PATH`, it throws one error 
message like
```
    xxx: command not found: Fri
```
That's all!
