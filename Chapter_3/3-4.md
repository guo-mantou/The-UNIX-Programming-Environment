# 3-4

Exercise 3-4. How do you tell *grep* to search for a pattern beginning with a '-'? Why 
doesn't quoting the argument help? Hint: investigate the -e option.

Answer:

To search for a pattern beginning with a '-', use `grep -e` like:
```
$ grep -e -1
3-1.md:# 3-1
3-1.md:Exercise 3-1. What are the differences among the following three commands?
3-3.md:3-1.md  3-2.md  3-3.md
```

Type `man grep` to get more details about `-e` option of grep:
```
-e PATTERNS, --regexp=PATTERNS
              Use  PATTERNS  as  the  patterns.  If this option is used multiple times or is combined with the -f (--file) option, search for all patterns given.  This option can be used to protect a pattern beginning with “-”.
```
