# 3-15

**Exercise 3-15**. If the *diff* loop were placed in a shell file, would you put the *pick* in 
the shell file? Why or why not?

**Answer**:

No, I won't do that.

The *diff* loop placed in shell file would be:
```
    for i in $*
    do
        echo $i:
        diff old/$i $i
    done | pr | lpr
```
Note that `pick ch2.*` is replaced by `$*`.

If you want to execute a script, generally you would give some concrete arguments rather than
 something like `ch2.*`, and you wouldn't need to pick them again in shell file.
