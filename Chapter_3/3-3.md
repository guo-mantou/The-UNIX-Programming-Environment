# 3-3

Exercise 3-3. Predict what each of the following *grep* commands will do, then verify 
your understanding.

```
grep \$         grep \\
grep \\$        grep \\\\
grep \\\$       grep "\$"
grep '\$'       grep '"$'
grep '\'$'      grep "$"
```

A file containing these commands themselves makes a good test case if you want to 
experiment. 

> grep \$

> grep \\

> grep \\$

> grep \\\\

> grep \\\$

> grep "\$"

`"..."` in shell could take `...` literally after `$`, `\`\``, and `\\` interpreted. 

> grep '\$'

`''` in shell could take `...` literally.

The `$` regular expression pattern specifies **the end of file**. Add a backslash (\) 
before it makes it literal. So this command is used to search literal `$` in standard 
input.
