# 3-7

Exercise. What happens with
```
    $ cat x y >y
```
and
```
    $ cat x >>x
```
Think before rushing off to try them.

Answer:

> $ cat x y \> y

This will redirect concatenated contents of file x and y to file y.  **<-- WRONG**

> $ cat x >\>x

This will append content of x to x.  **<-- WRONG**

Right answer:
Both of these will output **cat: x: input file is output file** in ubuntu 20.04. Seem like that output files cannot 
include one or more input files. 

TODO:
- [] Figure out about the principles of shell redirection.
