# 3-12

**Exercise 3-12**. 
```
    $ grep -l pattern filename
```
lists the filenames in which there was a match of *pattern*, but produces no other output. 
Try some variations on
```
    $ command `grep -l pattern filenames`
```

**Answer**:

VARIATION 1

The following command let you view concatenation of contents of markdown files which contain pattern *md* by *less*:
```
    $ cat `grep -l md *.md` | less
```

VARIATION 2

This command does things somewhat like VARIATION 1, by not *cat* but *pr* command, which gives you a more readable experience:
```
    $ pr `grep -l md *.md` | less
```

That's done!
