# 3-17

Exercise 3-17. How would you use *bundle* to send all the files in a directory and its subdirectories?  Hint: shell files can be recursive.

Answer:

Like this:
```
# bundle:  group files into distribution package

echo '# To unbundle, sh this file'
for i
do
    if [ -d $i ]    # handle subdirectories
    then
        echo "#### get subdirectories $i ###"
        echo "mkdir $i"
        $0 $i/*       # recursive bundle
    elif [ -s $i ]    # verify if $i exsits
    then
        echo "echo $i 1>&2"
        echo "cat >$i <<'End of $i'"   # shell's here documents
        cat $i
        echo "End of $i"
    fi
done
```

Done!
