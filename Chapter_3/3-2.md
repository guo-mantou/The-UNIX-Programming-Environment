# 3-2

Exercise 3-2. Explain the output produced by
```
$ ls .*
```

Answer:

The output produced by `ls .*` is the files whose name begin with a dot (.), except `.` and `..`.

When there are directories named like that, this command will print the files included by them as well.

For example:
```
$ ls -a
.  ..  Chapter_2  Chapter_3  .git  LICENSE  README.md  rmbackupfile.sh  the-unix-push.sh  .tmp

$ ls .*
.tmp

.git:
branches  COMMIT_EDITMSG  config  description  FETCH_HEAD  HEAD  hooks  index  info  logs  objects  ORIG_HEAD  packed-refs  refs

```

Finished!
