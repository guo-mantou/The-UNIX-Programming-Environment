# 3-8

Exercise 3-8. If you type
```
    $ rm *
```
why can't `rm` warn you that you're about to delete all your files?

Answer:

Well, I think there are two reasons about this.

Firstly, the asterisk (\*) is interpreted by `shell` rather than by `rm`, so the program (rm) will not feel
any difference with its regular progress like remove one or more files.

Secondly, the pattern (\*) will not match all the filenames beginning with a period (.) unless
a period is explicitly supplied in the pattern, such as `.*`.
