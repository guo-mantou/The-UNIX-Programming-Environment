# 2-10

Exercise 2-10. Tapes written on non-UNIX systems often have different block sizes, such 
as 800 bytes -- ten 80-character card images -- but the tape device */dev/mt0* expects 
512-byte blocks. Look up the *dd* command (dd(1)) to see how to read such a tape.

Answer:

*dd* command is used to **convert and copy file** in UNIX-like operating system. To read
a tape which has 800 bytes block size, just type the following:

```
$ sudo dd if=non-UNIX-tapes ibs=800 of=/dev/mt0 obs=512 
```

Let's analyze the command above. First of all we prefixed the actual command *dd* invocation 
with `sudo command`, in order to run the command with administrative privileges. `if` and `of` 
stand for *input file* and *output file* respectively. `ibs` stands for *input block size*, 
which set the amount of bytes read from the input file at a time. `obs` short for *output 
block size*, which set the amount of bytes written to the output file at a time.
