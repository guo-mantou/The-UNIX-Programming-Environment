Exercise 2-12. How does *write(1)* work? Hini: see *utmp(5)*.

Answer:

The *write(1)* command allows you to communicate with other users, by copying lines 
from your terminal to theirs. And the *utmp(5)* file allows one to discover infomation 
about who is currently using the system.

After knowing the functions of *write(1)* and *utmp(5)*, I guess that when one types 
`write someone`, the *write* command firstly goes to *utmp* file to get `someone`'s 
logging information, if success, establishes a connection with `someone`, then copies 
the content from terminal to `someone`'s.
