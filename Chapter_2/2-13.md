# 2-13

Exercise 2-13. How can you tell if a user has been active at the terminal recently?

Answer:

Well, the *who(1)* command can help us to achieve this.

Use *who* to show who is logged on, then you can tell if a specified user has been 
active at the terminal recently.

Besides, check `utmp` file could get more information about who is currently using the 
system. In Ubuntu, the path is `/var/run/utmp` and `/var/log/wtmp`.
