# 2-11

Exercise 2-11. Why isn't */dev/tty* just a link to your login terminal? What would 
happen if it were mode *rw--w--w-* like your login terminal?

Answer:

> Why isn't */dev/tty* just a link to your login terminal?

Because */dev/tty* is a synonym for current login terminal, it can't be a link to 
any specified terminal. For example, there are two users login in in one machine, 
any of them who types `who am i >/dev/tty` will get their own login information in 
standard input but the other one don't.

> What would happen if it were mode *rw--w--w-* like your login terminal?

Fist of all, */dev/tty* is owned by **root**, just like below.
```
$ ls -l /dev/tty
crw-rw-rw- 1 root tty 5, 0 Aug 13 09:59 /dev/tty

```

*/dev/tty* have mode *rw--w--w-*, that means the owner (root) has read and write 
permission, group and others only have write permission. If so, when a normal user 
type `who am i >/dev/tty`, he won't get any output because he don't have read permission 
to file */dev/tty*.
